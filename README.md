## This is the odin project "Project:Recipes"
 
 https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

 The project involves building a small website which shows you several recipes.
 all recipes are linked to the index.html page.


## Initial project setup notes

 So far I've setup a new git repsitory for the project "odin-recipes"
 - Cloned the project
 - Added files and folders to the project (cli commands)
 - Made a couple of git commits after staging changes.
 - Added html boilerplate language to each of the .html files in the project.

## Project Concepts

 Practiced usng a number of html tags including:
 - headings
 - anchors
 - list (ordered and unordered)
 - images (stored locally)

 Practiced using relative paths to locate resources
 Practiced commit functions and updated the modified project back to GitHub.
